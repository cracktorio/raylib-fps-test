## Compiling

As this project runs on raylib, you will need it installed.
The easiest way is to download the windows installer, which will install `notepad++ for raylib`.
Once installed, open `thingy.c` with npp for raylib and press `F6` in order to compile and execute the project (make sure the selected script is `raylib_compile_execute`).
